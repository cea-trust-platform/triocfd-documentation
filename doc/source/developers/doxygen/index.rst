C++ API (Doxygen)
---------------------

Doxygen code documentation is included here for use as reference in other sections of the documentation (description of the implementation of physical models and numerical methods).

Classes, methods and other objects from the c++ code can be cross-referenced in this documentation using the code-blocks "How to cite in this doc".

For example, you can reference :ref:`Objet\_U <class-objet-u>` with 

.. code:: rst
    
    :ref:`Objet\_U <class-objet-u>`

Look into each class (or other) to easily find the correct syntax.


Access the doxygen documentation here:


.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    ./rst/index.rst
