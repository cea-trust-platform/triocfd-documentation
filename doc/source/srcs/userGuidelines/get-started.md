# Get started

Welcome to the TrioCFD user guide !

TrioCFD is provided as source code only meaning that you will need to compile it yourself in order to use it. 
Build instructions can be found at the [Github repository](https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/TrioCFD-code).

Once built, you must source the shell environment generated by the build procedure (`env_TrioCFD.sh`).
This will allow you to start a TrioCFD simulation from the command line by using the command `triocfd`.

The triocfd executable must be provided a data file describing the physical problem you want to simulate and the numerical tools you want to use. This file uses an in-house format which allows to interface with the C++ implementation by specifying directives to execute and objects to instanciate.

See in Section [How to write a data file](./howto/index) for some guidelines on writing this file. The [Keyword Reference Manual](keywords) lists all valid keywords that can be used in a .data file, and describes the arguments they must be given.
