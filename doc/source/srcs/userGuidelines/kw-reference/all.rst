Thermal condition between two domains. Important: the name of the boundaries in the two
domains should be the same. (Warning: there is also an old limitation not yet fixed on the
sequential algorithm in VDF to detect the matching faces on the two boundaries: faces
should be ordered in the same way). The kind of condition depends on the discretization.
In VDF, it is a heat exchange condition, and in VEF, a temperature condition.

Such a coupling requires coincident meshes for the moment. In case of non-coincident
meshes, run is stopped and two external files are automatically generated in VEF
(connectivity_failed_boundary_name and connectivity_failed_pb_name.med). In 2D, the
keyword Decouper_bord_coincident associated to the connectivity_failed_boundary_name file
allows to generate a new coincident mesh.

In 3D, for a first preliminary cut domain with HOMARD (fluid for instance), the second
problem associated to pb_name (solide in a fluid/solid coupling problem) has to be
submitted to HOMARD cutting procedure with connectivity_failed_pb_name.med.

Such a procedure works as while the primary refined mesh (fluid in our example) impacts
the fluid/solid interface with a compact shape as described below (values 2 or 4 indicates
the number of division from primary faces obtained in fluid domain at the interface after
HOMARD cutting):

2-2-2-2-2-2

2-4-4-4-4-4-2 \\; 2-2-2

2-4-4-4-4-2 \\; 2-4-2

2-2-2-2-2 \\; 2-2

OK


2-2 \\; \\; 2-2-2

2-4-2 \\; 2-2

.. _champ_fonc_reprise:

**champ_fonc_reprise**
----------------------


This field is used to read a data field in a save file (.xyz or .sauv) at a specified
time. It is very useful, for example, to run a thermohydraulic calculation with velocity
initial condition read into a save file from a previous hydraulic calculation.

Parameters are:

- **[format]**  (*type:* string into ['binaire', 'formatte', 'xyz', 'single_hdf', 'pdi']) Type of file (the file format). If xyz format is activated, the .xyz file from the previous calculation will be given for filename, and if formatte or binaire is choosen, the .sauv file of the previous calculation will be specified for filename. In the case of a parallel calculation, if the mesh partition does not changed between the previous calculation and the next one, the binaire format should be preferred, because is faster than the xyz format. If pdi is used, the same constraints/advantages as binaire apply, but it produces one (HDF5) file per node on the filesystem instead of having one file per processor. The single_hdf format is still supported but is obsolete, the PDI format is recommended.

- **filename**  (*type:* string) Name of the save file.

- **pb_name**  (*type:* string) Name of the problem.

- **champ**  (*type:* string) Name of the problem unknown. It may also be the temporal average of a problem unknown (like moyenne_vitesse, moyenne_temperature,...)

- **[fonction]**  (*type:* :ref:`fonction_champ_reprise`) Optional keyword to apply a function on the field being read in the save file (e.g. to read a temperature field in Celsius units and convert it for the calculation on Kelvin units, you will use: fonction 1 273.+val )

- **temps | time**  (*type:* string) Time of the saved field in the save file or last_time. If you give the keyword last_time instead, the last time saved in the save file will be used.

Warning: Some implicit schemes do not permit high facsec_max, example Schema_Adams_Moulton_order_3 needs facsec=facsec_max=1.  Advice: The calculation may start with a facsec specified by the user and increased by the algorithm up to the facsec_max limit. But the user can also choose to specify a constant facsec (facsec_max will be set to facsec value then). Faster convergence has been seen and depends on the kind of calculation: -Hydraulic only or thermal hydraulic with forced convection and low coupling between velocity and temperature (Boussinesq value beta low), facsec between 20-30-Thermal hydraulic with forced convection and strong coupling between velocity and temperature (Boussinesq value beta high), facsec between 90-100 -Thermohydralic with natural convection, facsec around 300 -Conduction only, facsec can be set to a very high value (1e8) as if the scheme was unconditionally stableThese values can also be used as rule of thumb for initial facsec with a facsec_max limit higher.

- **[rapport_residus]**  (*type:* float) Ratio between the residual at time n and the residual at time n+1 above which the facsec is increased by multiplying by sqrt(rapport_residus) (1.2 by default).

Note about naming boundaries: When reading 'file', TRUST will detect boundaries between
domains (Raccord) when the name of the boundary begins by 'type_raccord\_'. For example, a
boundary named type_raccord_wall in 'file' will be considered by TRUST as a boundary named
'wall' between two domains.

mesh then use Create_domain_from_sub_domain keyword.

NB: If the MED file contains one or several subdomaine defined as a group of volumes,
then Read_MED will read it and will create two files domain_name_ssz.geo and
domain_name_ssz_par.geo defining the subdomaines for sequential and/or parallel
calculations. These subdomaines will be read in sequential in the datafile by including
(after Read_Med keyword) something like:

.. _tetraedriser:

----------------


To achieve a tetrahedral mesh based on a mesh comprising blocks, the Tetraedriser
(Tetrahedralise) interpretor is used in VEF discretization. Initial block is divided in 6
tetrahedra: 

.. image:: images/tetraedriser.jpeg
  :alt: images/tetraedriser.jpeg
  :scale: 80%
  :align: center



Parameters are:

- **domain_name**  (*type:* string) Name of domain.



----

.. _tetraedriser_homogene:

**tetraedriser_homogene**
-------------------------


Use the Tetraedriser_homogene (Homogeneous_Tetrahedralisation) interpretor in VEF
discretization to mesh a block in tetrahedrals. Each block hexahedral is no longer divided
into 6 tetrahedrals (keyword Tetraedriser (Tetrahedralise)), it is now broken down into 40
tetrahedrals. Thus a block defined with 11 nodes in each X, Y, Z direction will contain
10*10*10*40=40,000 tetrahedrals. This also allows problems in the mesh corners with the
P1NC/P1iso/P1bulle or P1/P1 discretization items to be avoided. Initial block is divided
in 40 tetrahedra: 

.. image:: images/tetraedriserhomogene.jpeg

Parameters are:

- **domain_name**  (*type:* string) Name of domain.



----

.. _tetraedriser_homogene_compact:

**tetraedriser_homogene_compact**

hexahedral elements. The process cut each hexahedral in 6 pyramids, each of them being cut
then in 4 tetrahedral. So, in comparison with tetra_homogene, less elements (*24 instead
of*40) with more homogeneous volumes are generated. Moreover, this process is done in a
faster way. Initial block is divided in 24 tetrahedra:

Parameters are:

- **domain_name**  (*type:* string) Name of domain.



----

.. _tetraedriser_homogene_fin:

block in 48 tetrahedra (against 24, previously). This cutting ensures :

- a correct cutting in the corners (in respect to pressure discretization PreP1B),

- a better isotropy of elements than with Tetraedriser_homogene_compact,

- a better alignment of summits (this could have a benefit effect on calculation near
  walls since first elements in contact with it are all contained in the same constant
  thickness and ii/ by the way, a 3D cartesian grid based on summits can be engendered and
  used to realise spectral analysis in HIT for instance). Initial block is divided in 48
  tetrahedra:

the jointed elements related with) and spectra (due to a better alignment of the points).

keyword into the list of fields to be post-processed. This estimator whill generate a map

- **[postraiter_gradient_pression_sans_masse]**  (*type:* flag) Avoid mass matrix multiplication for the gradient postprocessing

- **[methode_calcul_pression_initiale]**  (*type:* string into ['avec_les_cl', 'avec_sources', 'avec_sources_et_operateurs', 'sans_rien']) Keyword to select an option for the pressure calculation before the fist time step. Options are : avec_les_cl (default option lapP=0 is solved with Neuman boundary conditions on pressure if any), avec_sources (lapP=f is solved with Neuman boundaries conditions and f integrating the source terms of the Navier-Stokes equations) and avec_sources_et_operateurs (lapP=f is solved as with the previous option avec_sources but f integrating also some operators of the Navier-Stokes equations). The two last options are useful and sometime necessary when source terms are implicited when using an implicit time scheme to solve the Navier-Stokes equations.

.. _navier_stokes_ft_disc:

**navier_stokes_ft_disc**
-------------------------


Two-phase momentum balance equation.

Parameters are:

- **[equation_interfaces_proprietes_fluide]**  (*type:* string) This keyword is used for liquid-gas, liquid-vapor and fluid-fluid deformable interface, which transported at the Eulerian velocity. When this case is selected, the keyword sequence Methode_transport vitesse_interpolee is used in the block Transport_Interfaces_FT_Disc to define the velocity field for the displacement of the interface.

- **[equation_interfaces_vitesse_imposee]**  (*type:* string) This keyword is used to specify the velocity field to be used when using an interface that mimics a solid interface moving with a given solid speed of displacement. When this case is selected, the keyword sequence Methode_transport vitesse_imposee in the Transport_Interfaces_FT_Disc block will define the velocity field for the displacement of the interface.

- **[equations_interfaces_vitesse_imposee]**  (*type:* list of str) This keyword is used to specify the velocity field to be used when using an interface that mimics a solid interface moving with a given solid speed of displacement. When this case is selected, the keyword sequence Methode_transport vitesse_imposee in the Transport_Interfaces_FT_Disc block will define the velocity field for the displacement of the interface. If two or more solid interfaces are defined, then the keyword equations_interfaces_vitesse_imposee should be used.

- **[clipping_courbure_interface]**  (*type:* int) This keyword is used to numerically limit the values of curvature used in the momentum balance equation. Curvature is computed as usual, but values exceeding the clipping value are replaced by this threshold, before using the clipped curvature in the momentum balance. Each time a curvature value is clipped, a counter is increased by one unity and the value of the counter is written in the .err file at the end of the time step. This clipping allows not reducing drastically the time stepping when a geometrical singularity occurs in the interface mesh. However, physical phenomena may be concealed with the use of such a clipping.

- **[terme_gravite]**  (*type:* string into ['rho_g', 'grad_i']) The Terme_gravite keyword changes the numerical scheme used for the gravity source term. The default is grad_i, which is designed to remove spurious currents around the interface. In this case, the pressure field does not contain the hydrostatic part but only a jump across the interface. This scheme seems not to work very well in vef. The rho_g option uses the more traditional source term, equal to rho*g in the volume. In this case, the hydrostatic pressure is visible in the pressure field and the boundary conditions in pressure must be set accordingly. This model produces spurious currents in the vicinity of the fluid-fluid interfaces and with the immersed boundary conditions.

- **[equation_temperature_mpoint]**  (*type:* string) The equation_temperature_mpoint should be used in the case of liquid-vapor flow with phase-change (see the TRUST_ROOT/doc/TRUST/ft_chgt_phase.pdf written in French for more information about the model). The name of the temperature equation, defined with the convection_diffusion_temperature_ft_disc keyword, should be given.

- **[matrice_pression_invariante]**  (*type:* flag) This keyword is a shortcut to be used only when the flow is a single-phase one, with interface tracking only used for solid-fluid interfaces. In this peculiar case, the density of the fluid does not evolve during the computation and the pressure matrix does not need to be actuated at each time step.

- **[penalisation_forcage]**  (*type:* :ref:`penalisation_forcage`) This keyword is used to specify a strong formulation (value set to 0) or a weak formulation (value set to 1) for an imposed pressure boundary condition. The first formulation converges quicker and is stable in general cases except some rare cases (see Ecoulement_Neumann test case for example) where the second one should be used despite of its slow convergence.

----

.. _transport_interfaces_ft_disc:

**transport_interfaces_ft_disc**
--------------------------------


Interface tracking equation for Front-Tracking problem in the discontinuous version.

Parameters are:

- **[conditions_initiales | initial_conditions]**  (*type:* :ref:`bloc_lecture`) The keyword conditions_initiales is used to define the shape of the initial interfaces through the zero level-set of a function, or through a mesh fichier_geom. Indicator function is set to 0, that is fluide0, where the function is negative; indicator function is set to 1, that is fluide1, where the function is positive; the interfaces are the level-set 0 of that function:   conditions_initiales { fonction  $(-((x-0.002)^2+(y-0.002)^2+z^2-(0.00125)^2))*((x-0.005)^2+(y-0.007)^2+z^2 (0.00150)^2))*(0.020-z))$  }   In the above example, there are three interfaces: two bubbles in a liquid with a free surface. One bubble has a radius of 0.00125, i.e. 1.25 mm, and its center is {0.002, 0.002, 0.000}. The other bubble has a radius of 0.00150, i.e. 1.5 mm, and its center is {0.005, 0.007, 0.000}. The free surface is above the two bubble, at a level z=0.02.   Additional feature in this block concerns the keywords ajout_phase0 and ajout_phase1. They can be used to simplify the composition of different interfaces. When using these keywords, the initial function defines the indicator function; ajout_phase0 and ajout_phase1 are used to modify this initial field. Each time ajout_phase0 is used, the field is untouched where the function is positive whereas the indicator field is set to 0 where the function is negative. The keyword ajout_phase1 has the symmetrical use, keeping the field value where the function is negative and setting the indicator field to 1 where the function is positive. The previous example can also be written:   conditions_initiales {  fonction z-0.020 , NL fonction ajout_phase1 $(x-0.002)^2+(y-0.002)^2+z^2-(0.00125)^2$ ,  fonction ajout_phase1 $(x-0.005)^2+(y-0.007)^2+z^2-(0.00150)^2$  }

- **[methode_transport]**  (*type:* :ref:`methode_transport_deriv`) Method of transport of interface.

- **[iterations_correction_volume]**  (*type:* int) Keyword to specify the number or iterations requested for the correction process that can be used to keep the volume of the phases constant during the transport process.

- **[n_iterations_distance]**  (*type:* int) Keyword to specify the number or iterations requested for the smoothing process of computing the field corresponding to the signed distance to the interfaces and located at the center of the Eulerian elements. This smoothing is necessary when there are more Lagrangian nodes than Eulerian two-phase cells.

- **[maillage]**  (*type:* string) This optional block is used to specify that we want a Gnuplot drawing of the initial mesh. There is only one keyword, niveau_plot, that is used only to define if a Gnuplot drawing is active (value 1) or not active (value -1). By default, skipping the block will produce non Gnuplot drawing. This option is to be used only in a debug process.

- **[remaillage]**  (*type:* :ref:`bloc_lecture_remaillage`) This block is used to specify the operations that are used to keep the solid interfaces in a proper condition. The remaillage block only contains parameter\'s values.

- **[collisions]**  (*type:* string) This block is used to specify the operations that are used when a collision occurs between two parts of interfaces. When this occurs, it is necessary to build a new mesh that has locally a clear definition of what is inside and what is outside of the mesh. The collisions can either be active or inactive. If the collisions are active (highly recommended), a Juric level-set reconstruction method will be used to re-create the new mesh after each coalescence or breakup. An option Juric_local phase_continue N can be used to force the remeshing to impact only a local portion of the mesh, near the collision. The next line (type_remaillage) is used to state whose field will be used for the level-set computation. Main option is Juric, a remeshing that is compatible with parallel computing. When using Juric level-set remeshing, the source field (source_isovaleur) that is used to compute the level-sets is then defined. It can be either the indicator function (indicatrice), a choice which is the default one and the most robust, or a geometrical distance computed from the mesh at the beginning of the time step (fonction_distance), a choice that may be more accurate in specific situations. Type_remaillage can be either Juric or Thomas. When Thomas is used, it is an enhancement of the Juric remeshing algorithm designed to compensate for mass loss during remeshing. The mesh is always reconstructed with the indicator function (not with the distance function). After having reconstructed the mesh with the Juric algorithm, the difference between the old indicator function (before remeshing) and the new indicator function is computed. The differences occuring at a distance below or equal to N elements from the interface are summed up and used to move the interface in the normal direction. The displacement of the interface is such that the volume of each phase after displacement is equal to the volume of the phase before remeshing. N (default value 1) must be smaller than n_iterations_distance (suggested value: 2).

- **[methode_interpolation_v]**  (*type:* string into ['valeur_a_elem', 'vdf_lineaire']) In this block, two keywords are possible for method to select the way the interpolation is performed. With the choice valeur_a_elem the speed of displacement of the nodes of the interfaces is the velocity at the center of the Eulerian element in which each node is located at the beginning of the time step. This choice is the default interpolation method. The choice VDF_lineaire is only available with a VDF discretization (VDF). In this case, the speed of displacement of the nodes of the interfaces is linearly interpolated on the 4 (in 2D) or the 6 (in 3D) Eulerian velocities closest the location of each node at the beginning of the time step. In peculiar situation, this choice may provide a better interpolated value. Of course, this choice is not available with a VEF discretization (VEFPreP1B).

- **[volume_impose_phase_1]**  (*type:* float) this keyword is used to specify the volume of one phase to keep the volume of the phases constant during the remeshing process. It is an alternate solution to trouble in mass conservation. This option is mainly realistic when only one inclusion of phase 1 is present in the domain. In most other situations, the iterations_correction_volume keyword seems easier to justify. The volume to be keep is in m3 and should agree with initial condition.

- **[parcours_interface]**  (*type:* :ref:`parcours_interface`) Parcours_interface allows you to configure the algorithm that computes the surface mesh to volume mesh intersection. This algorithm has some serious trouble when the surface mesh points coincide with some faces of the volume mesh. Effects are visible on the indicator function, in VDF when a plane interface coincides with a volume mesh surface.  To overcome these problems, the keyword correction_parcours_thomas keyword can be used: it allows the algorithm to slightly move some mesh points. This algorithm is experimental and is NOT activated by default.

- **[interpolation_repere_local]**  (*type:* flag) Triggers a new transport algorithm for the interface: the velocity vector of lagrangian nodes is computed in the moving frame of reference of the center of each connex component, in such a way that relative displacements of nodes within a connex component of the lagrangian mesh are minimized, hence reducing the necessity of barycentering, smooting and local remeshing. Very efficient for bubbly flows.

- **[interpolation_champ_face]**  (*type:* :ref:`interpolation_champ_face_deriv`) It is possible to compute the imposed velocity for the solid-fluid interface by direct affectation (interpolation_scheme would be set to base) or by multi-linear interpolation (interpolation_scheme would be set to lineaire). The default value is base.

- **[n_iterations_interpolation_ibc]**  (*type:* int) Useful only with interpolation_champ_face positioned to lineaire. Set the value concerning the width of the region of the linear interpolation. For the Penalized Direct Forcing model, a value equals to 1 is enough.

- **[type_vitesse_imposee]**  (*type:* string into ['uniforme', 'analytique']) Useful only with interpolation_champ_face positioned to lineaire. Value of the keyword is uniforme (for an uniform solid-fluide interface\'s velocity, i.e. zero for instance) or analytique (for an analytic expression of the solid-fluide interface\'s velocity depending on the spatial coordinates). The default value is uniforme.

- **[nombre_facettes_retenues_par_cellule]**  (*type:* int) Keyword to specify the default number (3) of facets per cell used to describe the geometry of the solid-solid interface. This number should be increased if the geometry of the solid-solid interface is complex in each cell (eulerian mesh too coarse for example).

- **[seuil_convergence_uzawa]**  (*type:* float) Optional option to change the default value (10-8) of the threshold convergence for the Uzawa algorithm if used in the Penalized Direct Forcing model. Sometime, the value should be decreased to insure a better convergence to force equality between sequential and parallel results.

- **[nb_iteration_max_uzawa]**  (*type:* int) Optional option to change the default value (10-8) of the threshold convergence for the Uzawa algorithm if used in the Penalized Direct Forcing model. Sometime, the value should be decreased to insure a better convergence to force equality between sequential and parallel results.

The default value is 1 and is generally correct for all algorithms except the QUICK convection scheme that require a thickness of 2. Since the 1.5.5 version, the VEF discretization imply also a thickness of 2 (except VEF P0). Any non-zero positive value can be used, but the amount of data to store and exchange between processors grows quickly with the thickness.

- **[nom_zones | zones_name]**  (*type:* string) Name of the files containing the different partition of the domain. The files will be :  name_0001.Zones  name_0002.Zones  ...  name_000n.Zones.

This option might be used to perform coupled parallel computations. Supplemental empty domaines from M to N-1 are created. This keyword is used when you want to run a parallel calculation on several domains with for example, 2 processors on a first domain and 10 on the second domain because the first domain is very small compare to second one. You will write Nb_parts 2 and Nb_parts_tot 10 for the first domain and Nb_parts 10 for the second domain.

- **[periodique]**  (*type:* list of str) N BOUNDARY_NAME_1 BOUNDARY_NAME_2 ... : N is the number of boundary names given. Periodic boundaries must be declared by this method. The partitionning algorithm will ensure that facing nodes and faces in the periodic boundaries are located on the same processor.

- **[reorder]**  (*type:* int) If this option is set to 1 (0 by default), the partition is renumbered in order that the processes which communicate the most are nearer on the network. This may slighlty improves parallel performance.

- **[single_hdf]**  (*type:* flag) Optional keyword to enable you to write the partitioned domaines in a single file in hdf5 format.

- **[print_more_infos]**  (*type:* int) If this option is set to 1 (0 by default), print infos about number of remote elements (ghosts) and additional infos about the quality of partitionning. Warning, it slows down the cutting operations.

.. _convection_generic:

**convection_generic**
----------------------

**Synonyms:** generic


Keyword for generic calling of upwind and muscl convective scheme in VEF discretization.
For muscl scheme, limiters and order for fluxes calculations have to be specified. The
available limiters are : minmod - vanleer -vanalbada - chakravarthy - superbee, and the
order of accuracy is 1 or 2. Note that chakravarthy is a non-symmetric limiter and
superbee may engender results out of physical limits. By consequence, these two limiters
are not recommended.

Examples:

convection { generic amont }

convection { generic muscl minmod 1 }

convection { generic muscl vanleer 2 }


In case of results out of physical limits with muscl scheme (due for instance to strong
non-conformal velocity flow field), user can redefine in data file a lower order and a
smoother limiter, as : convection { generic muscl minmod 1 }

Parameters are:

- **type**  (*type:* string into ['amont', 'muscl', 'centre']) type of scheme

- **[limiteur]**  (*type:* string into ['minmod', 'vanleer', 'vanalbada', 'chakravarthy', 'superbee']) type of limiter

it allows the algorithm to slightly move some mesh points. This algorithm, which is
experimental and is NOT activated by default, triggers a correction that avoids some
errors in the computation of the indicator function for surface meshes that exactly cross

.. _partitionneur_fichier_decoupage:

**partitionneur_fichier_decoupage**
-----------------------------------

**Synonyms:** fichier_decoupage


This algorithm reads an array of integer values on the disc, one value for each mesh
element. Each value is interpreted as the target part number n>=0 for this element. The
number of parts created is the highest value in the array plus one. Empty parts can be
created if some values are not present in the array.

The file format is ASCII, and contains space, tab or carriage-return separated integer
values. The first value is the number nb_elem of elements in the domain, followed by
nb_elem integer values (positive or zero).

This algorithm has been designed to work together with the \'ecrire_decoupage\' option.
You can generate a partition with any other algorithm, write it to disc, modify it, and
read it again to generate the .Zone files.

Contrary to other partitioning algorithms, no correction is applied by default to the
partition (eg. element 0 on processor 0 and corrections for periodic boundaries). If
\'corriger_partition\' is specified, these corrections are applied.

Parameters are:

- **fichier**  (*type:* string) File name

- **[corriger_partition]**  (*type:* flag) not_set

- **[nb_parts]**  (*type:* int) The number of non empty parts that must be generated (generally equal to the number of processors in the parallel run).

- **[nb_parts]**  (*type:* int) The number of non empty parts that must be generated (generally equal to the number of processors in the parallel run).



----

.. _partitionneur_metis:

**partitionneur_metis**
-----------------------

**Synonyms:** metis


Metis is an external partitionning library. It is a general algorithm that will generate a
partition of the domain.

Parameters are:

- **[kmetis]**  (*type:* flag) The default values are pmetis, default parameters are automatically chosen by Metis. \'kmetis\' is faster than pmetis option but the last option produces better partitioning quality. In both cases, the partitioning quality may be slightly improved by increasing the nb_essais option (by default N=1). It will compute N partitions and will keep the best one (smallest edge cut number). But this option is CPU expensive, taking N=10 will multiply the CPU cost of partitioning by 10.  Experiments show that only marginal improvements can be obtained with non default parameters.

- **[use_weights]**  (*type:* flag) If use_weights is specified, weighting of the element-element links in the graph is used to force metis to keep opposite periodic elements on the same processor. This option can slightly improve the partitionning quality but it consumes more memory and takes more time. It is not mandatory since a correction algorithm is always applied afterwards to ensure a correct partitionning for periodic boundaries.

- **[nb_parts]**  (*type:* int) The number of non empty parts that must be generated (generally equal to the number of processors in the parallel run).

This algorithm will create one part for each specified subdomaine/domain. All elements
contained in the first subdomaine/domain are put in the first part, all remaining elements
contained in the second subdomaine/domain in the second part, etc...

If all elements of the current domain are contained in the specified subdomaines/domain,
then N parts are created, otherwise, a supplemental part is created with the remaining
elements.

If no subdomaine is specified, all subdomaines defined in the domain are used to split
the mesh.

Parameters are:

- **[sous_zones]**  (*type:* list of str) N SUBZONE_NAME_1 SUBZONE_NAME_2 ...

- **[domaines]**  (*type:* list of str) N DOMAIN_NAME_1 DOMAIN_NAME_2 ...

.. _partitionneur_tranche:

**partitionneur_tranche**
-------------------------

**Synonyms:** tranche


This algorithm will create a geometrical partitionning by slicing the mesh in the two or
three axis directions, based on the geometric center of each mesh element. nz must be
given if dimension=3. Each slice contains the same number of elements (slices don\'t have
the same geometrical width, and for VDF meshes, slice boundaries are generally not flat
except if the number of mesh elements in each direction is an exact multiple of the number
of slices). First, nx slices in the X direction are created, then each slice is split in
ny slices in the Y direction, and finally, each part is split in nz slices in the Z
direction. The resulting number of parts is nx*ny*nz. If one particular direction has been
declared periodic, the default slicing (0, 1, 2, ..., n-1)is replaced by (0, 1, 2, ...
n-1, 0), each of the two \'0\' slices having twice less elements than the other slices.

Parameters are:

- **[tranches]**  (*type:* list of int) Partitioned by nx in the X direction, ny in the Y direction, nz in the Z direction. Works only for structured meshes. No warranty for unstructured meshes.

.. _coupled_problem:

**coupled_problem**
-------------------

**Synonyms:** probleme_couple


This instruction causes a probleme_couple type object to be created. This type of object
has an associated problem list, that is, the coupling of n problems among them may be
processed. Coupling between these problems is carried out explicitly via conditions at
particular contact limits. Each problem may be associated either with the Associate
keyword or with the Read/groupes keywords. The difference is that in the first case, the
four problems exchange values then calculate their timestep, rather in the second case,
the same strategy is used for all the problems listed inside one group, but the second
group of problem exchange values with the first group of problems after the first group
did its timestep. So, the first case may then also be written like this:

Probleme_Couple pbc

Read pbc { groupes { { pb1 , pb2 , pb3 , pb4 } } }

There is a physical environment per problem (however, the same physical environment could
be common to several problems).

Each problem is resolved in a domain.

Warning : Presently, coupling requires coincident meshes. In case of non-coincident
meshes, boundary condition \'paroi_contact\' in VEF returns error message (see
paroi_contact for correcting procedure).

Parameters are:

.. _pb_couple_rayo_semi_transp:

**pb_couple_rayo_semi_transp**
------------------------------


Problem coupling several other problems to which radiation coupling is added (for semi
transparent gas).

You have to associate a modele_rayo_semi_transp

You have to add a radiative term source in energy equation

Warning: Calculation with semi transparent gas model may lead to divergence when high
temperature differences are used. Indeed, the calculation of the stability time step of
the equation does not take in account the source term. In semi transparent gas model,
energy equation source term depends strongly of temperature via irradiance and stability
is not guaranteed by the calculated time step. Reducing the facsec of the time scheme is a
good tip to reach convergence when divergence is encountered.

declared in the beginning of the data file. Another difference with more classical TRUST
data file, lies in the fluids definition. The two-phase fluid (Fluide_Diphasique) is made
with two usual single-phase fluids (Fluide_Incompressible). As the list of equations to be
solved in the generic Front-Tracking problem is declared in the data file and not pre-

**Keywords derived from schema_temps_base**
===========================================

.. _euler_scheme:

**euler_scheme**
----------------

**Synonyms:** scheme_euler_explicit, schema_euler_explicite


This is the Euler explicit scheme.

Parameters are:

- **[tinit]**  (*type:* float) Value of initial calculation time (0 by default).

- **[tmax]**  (*type:* float) Time during which the calculation will be stopped (1e30s by default).

- **[tcpumax]**  (*type:* float) CPU time limit (must be specified in hours) for which the calculation is stopped (1e30s by default).

- **[dt_min]**  (*type:* float) Minimum calculation time step (1e-16s by default).

- **[dt_max]**  (*type:* string) Maximum calculation time step as function of time (1e30s by default).

- **[dt_sauv]**  (*type:* float) Save time step value (1e30s by default). Every dt_sauv, fields are saved in the .sauv file. The file contains all the information saved over time. If this instruction is not entered, results are saved only upon calculation completion. To disable the writing of the .sauv files, you must specify 0. Note that dt_sauv is in terms of physical time (not cpu time).

- **[nb_sauv_max]**  (*type:* int) Maximum number of timesteps that will be stored in backup file (10 by default). This value is only useful when doing a complete backup of the calculation with parallel PDI (as it needs to allocate the proper amount of dataspace in advance). If this number is reached (ie we already stored the data of nb_sauv_max timesteps in the file), the next checkpoints will overwrite the first ones

- **[dt_impr]**  (*type:* float) Scheme parameter printing time step in time (1e30s by default). The time steps and the flux balances are printed (incorporated onto every side of processed domains) into the .out file.

- **[facsec]**  (*type:* string) Value assigned to the safety factor for the time step (1. by default). It can also be a function of time. The time step calculated is multiplied by the safety factor. The first thing to try when a calculation does not converge with an explicit time scheme is to reduce the facsec to 0.5.  Warning: Some schemes needs a facsec lower than 1 (0.5 is a good start), for example Schema_Adams_Bashforth_order_3.

- **[seuil_statio]**  (*type:* float) Value of the convergence threshold (1e-12 by default). Problems using this type of time scheme converge when the derivatives dGi/dt  of all the unknown transported values Gi have a combined absolute value less than this value. This is the keyword used to set the permanent rating threshold.

- **[residuals]**  (*type:* :ref:`residuals`) To specify how the residuals will be computed (default max norm, possible to choose L2-norm instead).

- **[diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) Keyword to make the diffusive term in the Navier-Stokes equations implicit (in this case, it should be set to 1). The stability time step is then only based on the convection time step (dt=facsec*dt_convection). Thus, in some circumstances, an important gain is achieved with respect to the time step (large diffusion with respect to convection on tightened meshes). Caution: It is however recommended that the user avoids exceeding the convection time step by selecting a too large facsec value. Start with a facsec value of 1 and then increase it gradually if you wish to accelerate calculation. In addition, for a natural convection calculation with a zero initial velocity, in the first time step, the convection time is infinite and therefore dt=facsec*dt_max.

- **[seuil_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* float) This keyword changes the default value (1e-6) of convergency criteria for the resolution by conjugate gradient used for implicit diffusion.

- **[impr_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) Unactivate (default) or not the printing of the convergence during the resolution of the conjugate gradient.

- **[impr_extremums]**  (*type:* int) Print unknowns extremas

- **[no_error_if_not_converged_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) not_set

- **[no_conv_subiteration_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) not_set

- **[dt_start]**  (*type:* :ref:`dt_start`) dt_start dt_min : the first iteration is based on dt_min.  dt_start dt_calc : the time step at first iteration is calculated in agreement with CFL condition.  dt_start dt_fixe value : the first time step is fixed by the user (recommended when resuming calculation with Crank Nicholson temporal scheme to ensure continuity).

.. _implicit_euler_steady_scheme:

**implicit_euler_steady_scheme**
--------------------------------

**Synonyms:** schema_euler_implicite_stationnaire


This is the Implicit Euler scheme using a dual time step procedure (using local and global
dt) for steady problems. Remark: the only possible solver choice for this scheme is the
implicit_steady solver.

Parameters are:

- **[max_iter_implicite]**  (*type:* int) Maximum number of iterations allowed for the solver (by default 200)

- **[steady_security_facteur]**  (*type:* float) Parameter used in the local time step calculation procedure in order to increase or decrease the local dt value (by default 0.5). We expect a strictly positive value

- **[steady_global_dt]**  (*type:* float) This is the global time step used in the dual time step algorithm (by default 100). We expect a strictly positive value

- **solveur**  (*type:* :ref:`solveur_implicite_base`) This keyword is used to designate the solver selected in the situation where the time scheme is an implicit scheme. solver is the name of the solver that allows equation diffusion and convection operators to be set as implicit terms. Keywords corresponding to this functionality are Simple (SIMPLE type algorithm), Simpler (SIMPLER type algorithm) for incompressible systems, Piso (Pressure Implicit with Split Operator), and Implicite (similar to PISO, but as it looks like a simplified solver, it will use fewer timesteps, and ICE (for PB_multiphase). But it may run faster because the pressure matrix is not re-assembled and thus provides CPU gains.  Advice: Since the 1.6.0 version, we recommend to use first the Implicite or Simple, then Piso, and at least Simpler. Because the two first give a fastest convergence (several times) than Piso and the Simpler has not been validated. It seems also than Implicite and Piso schemes give better results than the Simple scheme when the flow is not fully stationary. Thus, if the solution obtained with Simple is not stationary, it is recommended to switch to Piso or Implicite scheme.

- **[tinit]**  (*type:* float) Value of initial calculation time (0 by default).

- **[tmax]**  (*type:* float) Time during which the calculation will be stopped (1e30s by default).

- **[tcpumax]**  (*type:* float) CPU time limit (must be specified in hours) for which the calculation is stopped (1e30s by default).

- **[dt_min]**  (*type:* float) Minimum calculation time step (1e-16s by default).

- **[dt_max]**  (*type:* string) Maximum calculation time step as function of time (1e30s by default).

- **[dt_sauv]**  (*type:* float) Save time step value (1e30s by default). Every dt_sauv, fields are saved in the .sauv file. The file contains all the information saved over time. If this instruction is not entered, results are saved only upon calculation completion. To disable the writing of the .sauv files, you must specify 0. Note that dt_sauv is in terms of physical time (not cpu time).

- **[nb_sauv_max]**  (*type:* int) Maximum number of timesteps that will be stored in backup file (10 by default). This value is only useful when doing a complete backup of the calculation with parallel PDI (as it needs to allocate the proper amount of dataspace in advance). If this number is reached (ie we already stored the data of nb_sauv_max timesteps in the file), the next checkpoints will overwrite the first ones

- **[dt_impr]**  (*type:* float) Scheme parameter printing time step in time (1e30s by default). The time steps and the flux balances are printed (incorporated onto every side of processed domains) into the .out file.

- **[facsec]**  (*type:* string) Value assigned to the safety factor for the time step (1. by default). It can also be a function of time. The time step calculated is multiplied by the safety factor. The first thing to try when a calculation does not converge with an explicit time scheme is to reduce the facsec to 0.5.  Warning: Some schemes needs a facsec lower than 1 (0.5 is a good start), for example Schema_Adams_Bashforth_order_3.

- **[seuil_statio]**  (*type:* float) Value of the convergence threshold (1e-12 by default). Problems using this type of time scheme converge when the derivatives dGi/dt  of all the unknown transported values Gi have a combined absolute value less than this value. This is the keyword used to set the permanent rating threshold.

- **[residuals]**  (*type:* :ref:`residuals`) To specify how the residuals will be computed (default max norm, possible to choose L2-norm instead).

- **[diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) Keyword to make the diffusive term in the Navier-Stokes equations implicit (in this case, it should be set to 1). The stability time step is then only based on the convection time step (dt=facsec*dt_convection). Thus, in some circumstances, an important gain is achieved with respect to the time step (large diffusion with respect to convection on tightened meshes). Caution: It is however recommended that the user avoids exceeding the convection time step by selecting a too large facsec value. Start with a facsec value of 1 and then increase it gradually if you wish to accelerate calculation. In addition, for a natural convection calculation with a zero initial velocity, in the first time step, the convection time is infinite and therefore dt=facsec*dt_max.

- **[seuil_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* float) This keyword changes the default value (1e-6) of convergency criteria for the resolution by conjugate gradient used for implicit diffusion.

By default, the first iteration is based on dt_calc.

- **[nb_pas_dt_max]**  (*type:* int) Maximum number of calculation time steps (1e9 by default).

- **[niter_max_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) This keyword changes the default value (number of unknowns) of the maximal iterations number in the conjugate gradient method used for implicit diffusion.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021999180900339

Parameters are:

- **[tinit]**  (*type:* float) Value of initial calculation time (0 by default).

- **[tmax]**  (*type:* float) Time during which the calculation will be stopped (1e30s by default).

- **[tcpumax]**  (*type:* float) CPU time limit (must be specified in hours) for which the calculation is stopped (1e30s by default).

- **[dt_min]**  (*type:* float) Minimum calculation time step (1e-16s by default).

- **[dt_max]**  (*type:* string) Maximum calculation time step as function of time (1e30s by default).

- **[dt_sauv]**  (*type:* float) Save time step value (1e30s by default). Every dt_sauv, fields are saved in the .sauv file. The file contains all the information saved over time. If this instruction is not entered, results are saved only upon calculation completion. To disable the writing of the .sauv files, you must specify 0. Note that dt_sauv is in terms of physical time (not cpu time).

- **[nb_sauv_max]**  (*type:* int) Maximum number of timesteps that will be stored in backup file (10 by default). This value is only useful when doing a complete backup of the calculation with parallel PDI (as it needs to allocate the proper amount of dataspace in advance). If this number is reached (ie we already stored the data of nb_sauv_max timesteps in the file), the next checkpoints will overwrite the first ones

- **[dt_impr]**  (*type:* float) Scheme parameter printing time step in time (1e30s by default). The time steps and the flux balances are printed (incorporated onto every side of processed domains) into the .out file.

- **[facsec]**  (*type:* string) Value assigned to the safety factor for the time step (1. by default). It can also be a function of time. The time step calculated is multiplied by the safety factor. The first thing to try when a calculation does not converge with an explicit time scheme is to reduce the facsec to 0.5.  Warning: Some schemes needs a facsec lower than 1 (0.5 is a good start), for example Schema_Adams_Bashforth_order_3.

- **[seuil_statio]**  (*type:* float) Value of the convergence threshold (1e-12 by default). Problems using this type of time scheme converge when the derivatives dGi/dt  of all the unknown transported values Gi have a combined absolute value less than this value. This is the keyword used to set the permanent rating threshold.

- **[residuals]**  (*type:* :ref:`residuals`) To specify how the residuals will be computed (default max norm, possible to choose L2-norm instead).

- **[diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) Keyword to make the diffusive term in the Navier-Stokes equations implicit (in this case, it should be set to 1). The stability time step is then only based on the convection time step (dt=facsec*dt_convection). Thus, in some circumstances, an important gain is achieved with respect to the time step (large diffusion with respect to convection on tightened meshes). Caution: It is however recommended that the user avoids exceeding the convection time step by selecting a too large facsec value. Start with a facsec value of 1 and then increase it gradually if you wish to accelerate calculation. In addition, for a natural convection calculation with a zero initial velocity, in the first time step, the convection time is infinite and therefore dt=facsec*dt_max.

- **[seuil_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* float) This keyword changes the default value (1e-6) of convergency criteria for the resolution by conjugate gradient used for implicit diffusion.

- **[impr_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) Unactivate (default) or not the printing of the convergence during the resolution of the conjugate gradient.

- **[impr_extremums]**  (*type:* int) Print unknowns extremas

- **[no_error_if_not_converged_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) not_set

- **[no_conv_subiteration_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) not_set

- **[dt_start]**  (*type:* :ref:`dt_start`) dt_start dt_min : the first iteration is based on dt_min.  dt_start dt_calc : the time step at first iteration is calculated in agreement with CFL condition.  dt_start dt_fixe value : the first time step is fixed by the user (recommended when resuming calculation with Crank Nicholson temporal scheme to ensure continuity).  By default, the first iteration is based on dt_calc.

- **[nb_pas_dt_max]**  (*type:* int) Maximum number of calculation time steps (1e9 by default).

- **[niter_max_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) This keyword changes the default value (number of unknowns) of the maximal iterations number in the conjugate gradient method used for implicit diffusion.

- **[precision_impr]**  (*type:* int) Optional keyword to define the digit number for flux values printed into .out files (by default 3).

- **[periode_sauvegarde_securite_en_heures]**  (*type:* float) To change the default period (23 hours) between the save of the fields in .sauv file.

- **[no_check_disk_space]**  (*type:* flag) To disable the check of the available amount of disk space during the calculation.

- **[disable_progress]**  (*type:* flag) To disable the writing of the .progress file.

- **[disable_dt_ev]**  (*type:* flag) To disable the writing of the .dt_ev file.

- **[gnuplot_header]**  (*type:* int) Optional keyword to modify the header of the .out files. Allows to use the column title instead of columns number.

for scalars, because of instablities encountered when dt>dt_CFL, the Crank Nicholson
scheme is not applied to scalar quantities. Scalars are treated according to Euler-

explicite under-iterations at dt<=dt_CFL). Parameters are the sames (but default values

.. _sch_cn_iteratif:

**sch_cn_iteratif**
-------------------


The Crank-Nicholson method of second order accuracy. A mid-point rule formulation is used
(Euler-centered scheme). The basic scheme is: $$u(t+1) = u(t) + du/dt(t+1/2)*dt$$ The
estimation of the time derivative du/dt at the level (t+1/2) is obtained either by
iterative process. The time derivative du/dt at the level (t+1/2) is calculated
iteratively with a simple under-relaxations method. Since the method is implicit, neither
the cfl nor the fourier stability criteria must be respected. The time step is calculated
in a way that the iterative procedure converges with the less iterations as possible.

Remark : for stationary or RANS calculations, no limitation can be given for time step
through high value of facsec_max parameter (for instance : facsec_max 1000). In
counterpart, for LES calculations, high values of facsec_max may engender numerical
instabilities.

not_set

Parameters are:

- **[facsec_max]**  (*type:* float) Maximum ratio allowed between time step and stability time returned by CFL condition. The initial ratio given by facsec keyword is changed during the calculation with the implicit scheme but it couldn\'t be higher than facsec_max value.

Advice: The calculation may start with a facsec specified by the user and increased by the algorithm up to the facsec_max limit. But the user can also choose to specify a constant facsec (facsec_max will be set to facsec value then).

- **solveur**  (*type:* :ref:`solveur_implicite_base`) This keyword is used to designate the solver selected in the situation where the time scheme is an implicit scheme. solver is the name of the solver that allows equation diffusion and convection operators to be set as implicit terms. Keywords corresponding to this functionality are Simple (SIMPLE type algorithm), Simpler (SIMPLER type algorithm) for incompressible systems, Piso (Pressure Implicit with Split Operator), and Implicite (similar to PISO, but as it looks like a simplified solver, it will use fewer timesteps, and ICE (for PB_multiphase). But it may run faster because the pressure matrix is not re-assembled and thus provides CPU gains.  Advice: Since the 1.6.0 version, we recommend to use first the Implicite or Simple, then Piso, and at least Simpler. Because the two first give a fastest convergence (several times) than Piso and the Simpler has not been validated. It seems also than Implicite and Piso schemes give better results than the Simple scheme when the flow is not fully stationary. Thus, if the solution obtained with Simple is not stationary, it is recommended to switch to Piso or Implicite scheme.

If this instruction is not entered, results are saved only upon calculation completion. To disable the writing of the .sauv files, you must specify 0. Note that dt_sauv is in terms of physical time (not cpu time).

- **[nb_sauv_max]**  (*type:* int) Maximum number of timesteps that will be stored in backup file (10 by default). This value is only useful when doing a complete backup of the calculation with parallel PDI (as it needs to allocate the proper amount of dataspace in advance). If this number is reached (ie we already stored the data of nb_sauv_max timesteps in the file), the next checkpoints will overwrite the first ones

- **[dt_impr]**  (*type:* float) Scheme parameter printing time step in time (1e30s by default). The time steps and the flux balances are printed (incorporated onto every side of processed domains) into the .out file.

- **[facsec]**  (*type:* string) Value assigned to the safety factor for the time step (1. by default). It can also be a function of time. The time step calculated is multiplied by the safety factor. The first thing to try when a calculation does not converge with an explicit time scheme is to reduce the facsec to 0.5.  Warning: Some schemes needs a facsec lower than 1 (0.5 is a good start), for example Schema_Adams_Bashforth_order_3.

- **[seuil_statio]**  (*type:* float) Value of the convergence threshold (1e-12 by default). Problems using this type of time scheme converge when the derivatives dGi/dt  of all the unknown transported values Gi have a combined absolute value less than this value. This is the keyword used to set the permanent rating threshold.

- **[residuals]**  (*type:* :ref:`residuals`) To specify how the residuals will be computed (default max norm, possible to choose L2-norm instead).

- **[diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) Keyword to make the diffusive term in the Navier-Stokes equations implicit (in this case, it should be set to 1). The stability time step is then only based on the convection time step (dt=facsec*dt_convection). Thus, in some circumstances, an important gain is achieved with respect to the time step (large diffusion with respect to convection on tightened meshes). Caution: It is however recommended that the user avoids exceeding the convection time step by selecting a too large facsec value. Start with a facsec value of 1 and then increase it gradually if you wish to accelerate calculation. In addition, for a natural convection calculation with a zero initial velocity, in the first time step, the convection time is infinite and therefore dt=facsec*dt_max.

- **[facsec_func]**  (*type:* string) Advanced facsec specification as a function

- **[resolution_monolithique]**  (*type:* :ref:`bloc_lecture`) Activate monolithic resolution for coupled problems. Solves together the equations corresponding to the application domains in the given order. All aplication domains of the coupled equations must be given to determine the order of resolution. If the monolithic solving is not wanted for a specific application domain, an underscore can be added as prefix. For example, resolution_monolithique { dom1 { dom2 dom3 } _dom4 } will solve in a single matrix the equations having dom1 as application domain, then the equations having dom2 or dom3 as application domain in a single matrix, then the equations having dom4 as application domain in a sequential way (not in a single matrix).

- **[max_iter_implicite]**  (*type:* int) Maximum number of iterations allowed for the solver (by default 200).

- **solveur**  (*type:* :ref:`solveur_implicite_base`) This keyword is used to designate the solver selected in the situation where the time scheme is an implicit scheme. solver is the name of the solver that allows equation diffusion and convection operators to be set as implicit terms. Keywords corresponding to this functionality are Simple (SIMPLE type algorithm), Simpler (SIMPLER type algorithm) for incompressible systems, Piso (Pressure Implicit with Split Operator), and Implicite (similar to PISO, but as it looks like a simplified solver, it will use fewer timesteps, and ICE (for PB_multiphase). But it may run faster because the pressure matrix is not re-assembled and thus provides CPU gains.  Advice: Since the 1.6.0 version, we recommend to use first the Implicite or Simple, then Piso, and at least Simpler. Because the two first give a fastest convergence (several times) than Piso and the Simpler has not been validated. It seems also than Implicite and Piso schemes give better results than the Simple scheme when the flow is not fully stationary. Thus, if the solution obtained with Simple is not stationary, it is recommended to switch to Piso or Implicite scheme.

- **[tinit]**  (*type:* float) Value of initial calculation time (0 by default).

- **[tmax]**  (*type:* float) Time during which the calculation will be stopped (1e30s by default).

- **[dt_min]**  (*type:* float) Minimum calculation time step (1e-16s by default).

- **[dt_max]**  (*type:* string) Maximum calculation time step as function of time (1e30s by default).

- **[dt_sauv]**  (*type:* float) Save time step value (1e30s by default). Every dt_sauv, fields are saved in the .sauv file. The file contains all the information saved over time. If this instruction is not entered, results are saved only upon calculation completion. To disable the writing of the .sauv files, you must specify 0. Note that dt_sauv is in terms of physical time (not cpu time).

- **[nb_sauv_max]**  (*type:* int) Maximum number of timesteps that will be stored in backup file (10 by default). This value is only useful when doing a complete backup of the calculation with parallel PDI (as it needs to allocate the proper amount of dataspace in advance). If this number is reached (ie we already stored the data of nb_sauv_max timesteps in the file), the next checkpoints will overwrite the first ones

- **[dt_impr]**  (*type:* float) Scheme parameter printing time step in time (1e30s by default). The time steps and the flux balances are printed (incorporated onto every side of processed domains) into the .out file.

- **[facsec]**  (*type:* string) Value assigned to the safety factor for the time step (1. by default). It can also be a function of time. The time step calculated is multiplied by the safety factor. The first thing to try when a calculation does not converge with an explicit time scheme is to reduce the facsec to 0.5.  Warning: Some schemes needs a facsec lower than 1 (0.5 is a good start), for example Schema_Adams_Bashforth_order_3.

- **[seuil_statio]**  (*type:* float) Value of the convergence threshold (1e-12 by default). Problems using this type of time scheme converge when the derivatives dGi/dt  of all the unknown transported values Gi have a combined absolute value less than this value.

- **[diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) Keyword to make the diffusive term in the Navier-Stokes equations implicit (in this case, it should be set to 1). The stability time step is then only based on the convection time step (dt=facsec*dt_convection). Thus, in some circumstances, an important gain is achieved with respect to the time step (large diffusion with respect to convection on tightened meshes). Caution: It is however recommended that the user avoids exceeding the convection time step by selecting a too large facsec value. Start with a facsec value of 1 and then increase it gradually if you wish to accelerate calculation. In addition, for a natural convection calculation with a zero initial velocity, in the first time step, the convection time is infinite and therefore dt=facsec*dt_max.

By default, the first iteration is based on dt_calc.

.. _scheme_euler_explicite_ale:

**scheme_euler_explicite_ale**
------------------------------

**Synonyms:** scheme_euler_explicit_ale, schema_euler_explicite_ale


This is the Euler explicit scheme used for ALE problems.

Parameters are:

- **[tinit]**  (*type:* float) Value of initial calculation time (0 by default).

- **[tmax]**  (*type:* float) Time during which the calculation will be stopped (1e30s by default).

- **[tcpumax]**  (*type:* float) CPU time limit (must be specified in hours) for which the calculation is stopped (1e30s by default).

- **[dt_min]**  (*type:* float) Minimum calculation time step (1e-16s by default).

- **[dt_max]**  (*type:* string) Maximum calculation time step as function of time (1e30s by default).

- **[dt_sauv]**  (*type:* float) Save time step value (1e30s by default). Every dt_sauv, fields are saved in the .sauv file. The file contains all the information saved over time. If this instruction is not entered, results are saved only upon calculation completion. To disable the writing of the .sauv files, you must specify 0. Note that dt_sauv is in terms of physical time (not cpu time).

- **[nb_sauv_max]**  (*type:* int) Maximum number of timesteps that will be stored in backup file (10 by default). This value is only useful when doing a complete backup of the calculation with parallel PDI (as it needs to allocate the proper amount of dataspace in advance). If this number is reached (ie we already stored the data of nb_sauv_max timesteps in the file), the next checkpoints will overwrite the first ones

- **[dt_impr]**  (*type:* float) Scheme parameter printing time step in time (1e30s by default). The time steps and the flux balances are printed (incorporated onto every side of processed domains) into the .out file.

- **[facsec]**  (*type:* string) Value assigned to the safety factor for the time step (1. by default). It can also be a function of time. The time step calculated is multiplied by the safety factor. The first thing to try when a calculation does not converge with an explicit time scheme is to reduce the facsec to 0.5.  Warning: Some schemes needs a facsec lower than 1 (0.5 is a good start), for example Schema_Adams_Bashforth_order_3.

- **[seuil_statio]**  (*type:* float) Value of the convergence threshold (1e-12 by default). Problems using this type of time scheme converge when the derivatives dGi/dt  of all the unknown transported values Gi have a combined absolute value less than this value. This is the keyword used to set the permanent rating threshold.

- **[residuals]**  (*type:* :ref:`residuals`) To specify how the residuals will be computed (default max norm, possible to choose L2-norm instead).

- **[diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) Keyword to make the diffusive term in the Navier-Stokes equations implicit (in this case, it should be set to 1). The stability time step is then only based on the convection time step (dt=facsec*dt_convection). Thus, in some circumstances, an important gain is achieved with respect to the time step (large diffusion with respect to convection on tightened meshes). Caution: It is however recommended that the user avoids exceeding the convection time step by selecting a too large facsec value. Start with a facsec value of 1 and then increase it gradually if you wish to accelerate calculation. In addition, for a natural convection calculation with a zero initial velocity, in the first time step, the convection time is infinite and therefore dt=facsec*dt_max.

- **[seuil_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* float) This keyword changes the default value (1e-6) of convergency criteria for the resolution by conjugate gradient used for implicit diffusion.

- **[impr_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) Unactivate (default) or not the printing of the convergence during the resolution of the conjugate gradient.

- **[impr_extremums]**  (*type:* int) Print unknowns extremas

- **[no_error_if_not_converged_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) not_set

- **[no_conv_subiteration_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) not_set

- **[dt_start]**  (*type:* :ref:`dt_start`) dt_start dt_min : the first iteration is based on dt_min.  dt_start dt_calc : the time step at first iteration is calculated in agreement with CFL condition.  dt_start dt_fixe value : the first time step is fixed by the user (recommended when resuming calculation with Crank Nicholson temporal scheme to ensure continuity).  By default, the first iteration is based on dt_calc.

- **[nb_pas_dt_max]**  (*type:* int) Maximum number of calculation time steps (1e9 by default).

- **[niter_max_diffusion_implicite]**  (*type:* int) This keyword changes the default value (number of unknowns) of the maximal iterations number in the conjugate gradient method used for implicit diffusion.

- **[precision_impr]**  (*type:* int) Optional keyword to define the digit number for flux values printed into .out files (by default 3).

- **[periode_sauvegarde_securite_en_heures]**  (*type:* float) To change the default period (23 hours) between the save of the fields in .sauv file.

- **[no_check_disk_space]**  (*type:* flag) To disable the check of the available amount of disk space during the calculation.

- **[disable_progress]**  (*type:* flag) To disable the writing of the .progress file.

- **[disable_dt_ev]**  (*type:* flag) To disable the writing of the .dt_ev file.

- **[gnuplot_header]**  (*type:* int) Optional keyword to modify the header of the .out files. Allows to use the column title instead of columns number.

**Synonyms:** cholesky


Parallelized version of Cholesky from MUMPS library. This solver accepts an option to
select a different ordering than the automatic selected one by MUMPS (and printed by using
the impr option). The possible choices are Metis, Scotch, PT-Scotch or Parmetis. The two
last options can only be used during a parallel calculation, whereas the two first are
available for sequential or parallel calculations. It seems that the CPU cost of A=LU
factorization but also of the backward/forward elimination steps may sometimes be reduced
by selecting a different ordering (Scotch seems often the best for b/f elimination) than
the default one.

Notice that this solver requires a huge amont of memory compared to iterative methods. To
know how much RAM you will need by core, then use the impr option to have detailled
informations during the analysis phase and before the factorisation phase (in the
following output, you will learn that the largest memory is taken by the zeroth CPU with
108MB):

Rank of proc needing largest memory in IC facto : 0

Estimated corresponding MBYTES for IC facto : 108

Thanks to the following graph, you read that in order to solve for instance a flow on a
mesh with 2.6e6 cells, you will need to run a parallel calculation on 32 CPUs if you have
cluster nodes with only 4GB/core (6.2GB*0.42~2.6GB) :

- **[read_matrix]**  (*type:* flag) save_matrix|read_matrix are the keywords to save|read into a file the constant matrix A of the linear system Ax=B solved (eg: matrix from the pressure linear system for an incompressible flow). It is useful when you want to minimize the MPI communications on massive parallel calculation. Indeed, in VEF discretization, the overlapping width (generaly 2, specified with the largeur_joint option in the partition keyword partition) can be reduced to 1, once the matrix has been properly assembled and saved. The cost of the MPI communications in TRUST itself (not in PETSc) will be reduced with length messages divided by 2. So the strategy is:  I) Partition your VEF mesh with a largeur_joint value of 2  II) Run your parallel calculation on 0 time step, to build and save the matrix with the save_matrix option. A file named Matrix_NBROWS_rows_NCPUS_cpus.petsc will be saved to the disk (where NBROWS is the number of rows of the matrix and NCPUS the number of CPUs used).  III) Partition your VEF mesh with a largeur_joint value of 1  IV) Run your parallel calculation completly now and substitute the save_matrix option by the read_matrix option. Some interesting gains have been noticed when the cost of linear system solve with PETSc is small compared to all the other operations.

.. _solveur_petsc_lu:

**solveur_petsc_lu**
--------------------

**Synonyms:** lu


Several solvers through PETSc API are available.

TIPS:



A) Solver for symmetric linear systems (e.g: Pressure system from Navier-Stokes
equations):

-The CHOLESKY parallel solver is from MUMPS library. It offers better performance than
all others solvers if you have enough RAM for your calculation. A parallel calculation on
a cluster with 4GBytes on each processor, 40000 cells/processor seems the upper limit.
Seems to be very slow to initialize above 500 cpus/cores.

-When running a parallel calculation with a high number of cpus/cores (typically more
than 500) where preconditioner scalabilty is the key for CPU performance, consider
BICGSTAB with BLOCK_JACOBI_ICC(1) as preconditioner or if not converges, GCP with
BLOCK_JACOBI_ICC(1) as preconditioner.

-For other situations, the first choice should be GCP/SSOR. In order to fine tune the
solver choice, each one of the previous list should be considered. Indeed, the CPU speed
of a solver depends of a lot of parameters. You may give a try to the OPTIMAL solver to
help you to find the fastest solver on your study.


B) Solver for non symmetric linear systems (e.g.: Implicit schemes):

The BICGSTAB/DIAG solver seems to offer the best performances.

Parameters are:

- **[seuil]**  (*type:* float) corresponds to the iterative solver convergence value. The iterative solver converges when the Euclidean residue standard ||Ax-B|| is less than seuil.

- **[quiet]**  (*type:* flag) is a keyword which is used to not displaying any outputs of the solver.

- **[impr]**  (*type:* flag) used to request display of the Euclidean residue standard each time this iterates through the conjugated gradient (display to the standard outlet).

- **[atol]**  (*type:* float) not_set

- **[thetac_tcl]**  (*type:* float) imposed contact angle [in degree] to force bubble pinching / necking once TCL entre nucleate site

- **[reinjection_tcl]**  (*type:* flag) This flag activates the automatic injection of a new nucleate seed with a specified shape when the temperature in the nucleation site becomes higher than a certain threshold (tempC_tcl). The shape of the seed is determined by the radius Rc_tcl_GridN and the contact angle thetaC_tcl. The nucleation site is considered free when there are no bubbles present. The site size is defined by Rc_tcl_GridN. This temperature threshold, termed tempC_tcl, is the activation temperature. Setting this temperature implies a wall temperature, therefore, activating reinjection_tcl is ONLY possible for a simulation coupled with solid conduction.  When reinjection_tcl is activated, the values of tempC_tcl (default 10K), Rc_tcl_GridN (default 4 grid sizes), and thetaC_tcl (default 150 degrees) should be provided. Unless (STRONGLY not recommended), the default values (indicated in parentheses) will be used.  If reinjection_tcl is not activated (by default), the mechanism of Numerically forcing bubble pinching/necking will be used for multi-cycle simulation. Once the Triple Contact Line (TCL) enters the nucleation site, a big contact angle thetaC_tcl is imposed to initiate bubble pinching/necking. After the bubble pinching ends, the large bubble above will depart, leaving the remaining part to serve as the nucleate seed. This process is equivalent to immediately inserting a new seed with a prescribed shape (determined by the nucleation site size and contact angle) once a bubble departs. Site size is defined by Rc_tcl_GridN (default 4 grid sizes). Contact angle thetaC_tcl (default 150 degrees). Useful for a standalone (not coupling with solid conduction) simulation.

- **[distri_first_facette]**  (*type:* flag) This flag determines whether to distribute the Qtcl into all grids occupied by the first facette according to their area proportions. When set, the flux is redistributed into all grids occupied by the first facette based on their area proportions. Default value is 0, the flux is distributed differently: similar to the Meso zone, it is only distributed to grids within the Micro-zone (where the height of the front y is smaller than the size of Micro ym). The distribution of this flux is logarithmically proportional to y between 5.6nm (here interpreted as the value 0 in logarithm) and ym. In practice, in most cases, it will distribute all the flux locally in the first grid.

- **[file_name]**  (*type:* float) Input file to set TCL model

- **[deactivate]**  (*type:* flag) Simple way to disable completely the TCL model contribution

- **[inout_method]**  (*type:* string into ['exact', 'approx', 'both']) Type of method for in out calc. By defautl, exact method is used

Keyword similar to keyword Loi_standard_hydr_scalaire but with additional option.

Parameters are:

- **[prdt_sur_kappa]**  (*type:* float) This option is to change the default value of 2.12 in the scalable wall function.

- **[calcul_ldp_en_flux_impose]**  (*type:* int into [0, 1]) By default (value set to 0), the law of the wall is not applied for a wall with a Neumann condition. With value set to 1, the law is applied even on a wall with Neumann condition.

.. _loi_odvm:

**loi_odvm**
------------


Thermal wall-function based on the simultaneous 1D resolution of a turbulent thermal
boundary-layer and a variance transport equation, adapted to conjugate heat-transfer
problems with fluid/solid thermal interaction (where a specific boundary condition should
be used : Paroi_Echange_Contact_OVDM_VDF). This law is also available with isothermal
walls.

Parameters are:

- **n**  (*type:* int) Number of points per face in the 1D uniform meshes. n should be choosen in order to have the first point situated near $\Delta$ y+=1/3.

- **gamma**  (*type:* float) Smoothing parameter of the signal between 10e-5 (no smoothing) and 10e-1 (high averaging).

- **[stats]**  (*type:* :ref:`floatfloat`) value_t0 value_dt : Only for plane channel flow, it gives mean and root mean square profiles in the fine meshes, since value_t0 and every value_dt seconds. The values are printed into files named ODVM_fields*.dat.

- **[check_files]**  (*type:* flag) It gives for one boundary face a historical view of local instantaneous and filtered values, as well as the calculated variance profiles from the resolution of the equation. The printed values are into the file Suivi_ndeb.dat.

.. _loi_paroi_nu_impose:

**loi_paroi_nu_impose**
-----------------------


Keyword to impose Nusselt numbers on the wall for the thermohydraulic problems. To use
this option, it is necessary to give in the data file the value of the hydraulic diameter
and the expression of the Nusselt number.

Parameters are:

- **nusselt**  (*type:* string) The Nusselt number. This expression can be a function of x, y, z, Re (Reynolds number), Pr (Prandtl number).

- **diam_hydr**  (*type:* :ref:`field_base`) The hydraulic diameter.

.. _paroi_tble_scal:

**paroi_tble_scal**
-------------------


Keyword for the Thin Boundary Layer Equation thermal wall-model.

Parameters are:

- **[n]**  (*type:* int) Number of nodes in the TBLE grid (mandatory option).

- **[facteur]**  (*type:* float) Stretching ratio for the TBLE grid (to refine, the TBLE facteur must be greater than 1).

- **[modele_visco]**  (*type:* string) File name containing the description of the eddy viscosity model.

- **[nb_comp]**  (*type:* int) Number of component to solve in the fine grid (1 if 2D simulation (2D not available yet), 2 if 3D simulation).

- **[stats]**  (*type:* :ref:`fourfloat`) Statistics of the TBLE velocity and turbulent viscosity profiles. 4 values are required : the starting time of velocity averaging, the starting time of the RMS fluctuations, the ending time of the statistics computation and finally the print time period for the statistics.

- **[sonde_tble]**  (*type:* list of Sonde_tble) not_set
