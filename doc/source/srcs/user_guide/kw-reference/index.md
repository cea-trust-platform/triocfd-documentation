# Keywords Reference Manual

This page lists all available TrioCFD keywords available to use in data files.

It contains the keywords inherited from TRUST (available [here](https://cea-trust-platform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_srcs_processed/reference/)), as well as most additional keywords defined by TrioCFD. Keywords have to be documented with the [XDATA](XDATA) syntax in order to appear in this reference manual.

Note: this reference manual can be generated from the TrioCFD source code using `make trustify_doc`, which will generate the file `all.rst` included here.

You can use the [search](search) feature (on the left menu or shortcut {kbd}`Ctrl` + {kbd}`K`) to find info about a specific keyword.
