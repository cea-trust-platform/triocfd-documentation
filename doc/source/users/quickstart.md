# Quick Start

Welcome to the TrioCFD user guide !

TrioCFD is provided as source code only meaning that you will need to compile it yourself in order to use it. 

For downloading and building TrioCFD, please refer to the [README file](https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/TrioCFD-code) of TrioCFD.

Once built, to use TrioCFD, you must source the shell environment generated by the build procedure (`env_TrioCFD.sh`).
This will allow you to start a TrioCFD simulation from the command line by using the command `triocfd`.
You may also directly use the executable generated at the root of the project directory: `TrioCFD_opt`.

The triocfd executable must be provided a data file describing the physical problem you want to simulate and the numerical tools you want to use. This file uses an in-house format which allows to interface with the C++ implementation by specifying directives to execute and objects to instanciate.

See in Section [How to write a data file](./howto/index) for some guidelines on writing this file. The [](keywords-target) lists all valid keywords that can be used in a .data file, and describes the arguments they must be given.

Usually, it is easier to start from an existing file, especially when learning. To make this easier, you can copy an existing test case using `triocfd -copy <test_name>`.
The [Tutorial section](tutorials) provides some examples which will accompany you toward adapting existing datasets to specific use cases.
